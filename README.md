# Streetview Paper Code Repository

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is a repository with R implementations of the code for the first
manuscript of my thesis:

Randy Boyes, William Pickett, Ian Janssen et al. Physical environment
features that predict outdoor active play can be measured using Google
Street View images, 24 April 2023, PREPRINT (Version 1) available at
Research Square \[<https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2833694/v1>\]

## Installation

You can install the development version of streetview like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("rdboyes/streetview")
```

# Usage

I’m working on turning this into a package, but for now this repository
just contains the code used in the paper.
