## The Problem

How can we measure the things that children say are important?

## The Problem

```{r table2, out.width="60%"}
table1 <- data.frame(Qualitative = c('"Things to do"', 
                                 '"On the Street"', 
                                 '"People around"'),
                    `Local Quantitative` = c("Parks, points of interest",
                                  "Municipal traffic data",
                                  "Surveys, etc"),
                    `National Quantitative` = c("Parks, points of interest",
                                  "No standardized complete source",
                                  "Census proxy variables"))
```
\small
```{r, out.width="60%"}
knitr::kable(table1, booktabs = T, caption = "Available Data")
```
\normalsize

## A Solution?

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("sv_image.png"))
```

## A Solution?

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("sv_image_annotated.png"))
```

Part 1: Can images be used to measure built environment? 

## Methods

Semantic pixel-level image segmentation via neural network

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("SegNet-neural-network_2x.png"))
```

## Methods

The Cityscapes dataset contains 5,000 finely annotated street images.

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("cityscapes_example.png"))
```

## Methods

```{r, fig.align="center", out.height="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("segmenation_example.png"))
```

## Methods: Ground Truth

```{r table1}
table1 <- data.frame(Variable = c("Trees", 
                                 "Sidewalks", 
                                 "People Walking", 
                                 "Cars", 
                                 "Traffic Lights", 
                                 "Cyclists"),
                    Vancouver = c("Open Data Vancouver",
                                  "",
                                  "",
                                  "Open Data Vancouver",
                                  "Open Data Vancouver",
                                  ""),
                    Kingston = c("",
                                 "Open Data Kingston",
                                 "City of Kingston",
                                 "City of Kingston",
                                 "City of Kingston",
                                 "City of Kingston"))
knitr::kable(table1, booktabs = T, caption = "Sources for comparison variables")
```

## Methods: Points Queried from API

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

load(file = here::here('data/locations_xc.rda'))
load(here::here('data/buffers_van_50.rda'))
load(here::here('data/points_on_land_kng_all.rda'))
```

```{r, fig.cap="Points queried in Vancouver (above) and kingston (below).", fig.height = 8}
van_points <- ggplot(locations) + 
  geom_sf(alpha = 0.25, size = 0.1) + 
  theme_void() +
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(colour = "black", fill=NA, size=1))
  
kng_points <- ggplot(points_on_land) + 
  geom_sf(alpha = 0.25, size = 0.1) + 
  theme_void() +
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(colour = "black", fill=NA, size=1))
```

Streetview images were obtained every 150 m along each road: 

```{r, fig.cap="Kingston, ON"}
kng_points
```

## Methods: Points Queried from API

```{r, fig.cap="Vancouver, BC"}
van_points
```

## Identifying Traffic Lights

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("traffic_lights_kingston_crop.jpg"))
```

## Detecting Sidewalks

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("sidewalks_vs_true.png"))
```

## Measuring Vegetation

```{r, out.height = "60%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("tree_hex_map.png"))
```

## Measuring Vegetation

```{r, out.height = "70%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("trees_vs_veg.png"))
```

## Measuring Traffic Density: Pedestrians

```{r, out.height = "70%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("person.png"))
```

## Measuring Traffic Density: Cyclists

```{r, out.height = "70%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("bicycle.png"))
```

## Measuring Traffic Density: Buffer Sizing

```{r, out.height = "70%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("correlation_comparison.png"))
```

Part 2: Can we predict play with these measures?

## Methods

- Data Sources
  - Play data: 
    - Vancouver: Accelerometer (105 children)
    - Kingston: HBSC Survey (120 children)
  - Baseline data: Census, CAN-ALE, EPOI, OpenStreetMap
  - Image Data: Google StreetView API
  
## Methods

- Models included measurements within 500 on-road meters of "home"
  - Vancouver: Measured from actual home
  - Kingston: Measured from point on road nearest to postal code centroid

## Methods: Models of Play

- Variables
  - Baseline model: Street connectivity, parks and green space, points of interest, transit access, residential mobility, active transport utilization, housing type and density, population age distribution, cycling and walking paths
  - StreetView model: Baseline model, plus image-derived variables

## Methods: Models of Play

- Elastic net models, continuous outcome (minutes of play/day)
- Trained using 5-fold cross validation, tested on 30% holdout

## Results: Accuracy of Prediction

```{r}
table1 <- data.frame(Model = c('Baseline', 
                                 'Baseline + Images'),
                    MAE = c("24.4 Minutes",
                                  "19.6 Minutes"))
knitr::kable(table1, booktabs = T, caption = "Prediction Mean Absolute Error")
```

## Discussion

- Strengths
  - High coverage (~99% of North America)
  - Updated data
  - Standardized methodology
- Limitations
  - Weak correlations with ground truth variables in some cases
  - Rural areas have infrequent updates
  - Computationally expensive
  - Snapshot in time (summer, afternoon)

## Next Steps

- The next phase will test this method in the full HBSC sample (n > 10,000)
- Results to come!

## Conclusion
  
- Thanks to the Pickett Lab group for review

## Estimated Traffic Lights vs. True Count

```{r}
#knitr::include_graphics(here::here("True_TL_vs_SV.png"))
```

## Comparing with Play Behaviour

Comparing values at nearest point with play behaviour:

```{r, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
#knitr::include_graphics(here::here("univariate.png"))
